For me the biggest issues I faced with the btop compilation was that some of the commands I copied and pasted as is from the tut instructions, but there were some issues and also I didn't read the whole instruction necessarily.  For instance, in the git clone command there is an added "-r" parameter which my Ubuntu didn't like, and then in the make command I didn't read the whole command and ended up creating the btop in the fake directory placeholder and had to redo the make and delete the incorrect chain of directories that I created by mistake.
But besides these small issues, I enjoyed the btop creation, especially the end product.  It is quite a cool tool.  I also enjoyed playing around with the settings like changing the theme and stuff.
