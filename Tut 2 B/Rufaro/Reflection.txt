Reflection:
Dear Diary
This was actually quite fun to do and seeing everything after completion was satisfying. I did have some issues with the commands in the tut instruction for example this one:
   ```bash
   git clone -r https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git
   ```
Although it is unrelated I had an issue logging in every time I had to install something, not necessarily cause of anything I did wrong but i set up a long password for my VM and I was getting it wrong at least 2 times before proceeding. I am changing it to a much weaker password hehe.
But I am glad I have figured it out..baby steps(or adult strides considering I didn't know what a VM was 4 weeks ago)
